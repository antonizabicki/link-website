# LINK WEBSITE PROJECT

LINK-WEBSITE is a minimalist, fully customizable single HTML file designed to serve as your personal link hub â€” inspired by the Linktree format. It lets you display all your important links in one central place, perfect for bios, profiles, or anywhere you want to keep your links organized.
The page is super lightweight, easy to edit, and doesn't require any external libraries or complex setup. Just open the HTML file, tweak it to your style, and you're good to go.

## Installation
